# FYOScript
A script that automatically matches students with mentors based on common interests.

This script uses a variation of the stable-marriage algorithm to match students to mentors. The differences are due to mentors and students having the same preference or in our case, measured compatability with eachother, and that we allow mentors to have a maximum of two students.
